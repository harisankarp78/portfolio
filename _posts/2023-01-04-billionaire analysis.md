Today (4/1/2023) I did the billionaire analysis. Data set was from kaggle. The data set contained empty rows. Deleted all the empty values. It was nice doing this. Identified top 5 industries to become billionaire. I found that China and the United States are the countries with the most billionaires which concludes that the business environment and the success rate of a startup is much better in the US and China than in the rest of the world.
I took 3 tomatoes to complete the task which included a 5 minute break. 

**Key tools used:** Python, Jupyter notebook

**Findings**

1. Jeff Bezos is the top among billionaires.
2. Persons from technology industry are the majority among billionaire.
3. I found that United States and China are the countries with the most billionaires which concludes that the business environment and the success rate of a startup is much better in the US and China than in the rest of the world.
4. India has 3rd largest pool of billionaires.
5. Fashion and retail is the industry which has most number of billionaire.
