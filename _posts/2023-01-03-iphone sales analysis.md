Today (3/1/2023) I have done iphone sales analysis in India. I got the data set from Kaggle. Analyzed and identified top 10 iphones sold in India. Visualized using plotly and seaborn. Used pandas for EDA. It was nice experience doing this project.
25 minutes is equal to 1 tomato. I took 2 tomatoes to complete the task which included a 5 minute break. 

**Key tools used:** Python, Jupyter notebook

**Findings**

1. iPhones with high discounts are sold more in India
2. APPLE iPhone 11 Pro Max (Midnight Green, 64 GB) is the most rated phone in 2022.
3. APPLE iPhone 8 Plus (Gold, 64 GB) was the most appreciated iPhone in India is the most discussed  phone in India.
4. iPhones with lower sale prices are sold more in India.
