I have completed the first data analysis project of the new year 2023. I have analyzed and visualized screen time using python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. I got the data set from kaggle. I implemented a new method of [pomodoro technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). It was completely new for me. It looks and feels very effective in terms of time management. 
25 minutes is equal to 1 tomato. I took 2 tomatoes to complete the task which included a 5 minute break.
