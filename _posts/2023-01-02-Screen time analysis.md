I have completed the first data analysis project of the new year 2023. I have analyzed and visualized screen time using python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. I got the data set from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I implemented a new method of [pomodoro technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). It was completely new for me. It looks and feels very effective in terms of time management. 25 minutes is equal to 1 tomato. I took 2 tomatoes to complete the task which included a 5 minute break. 

**Key tools used:** Python, Jupyter notebook

**Findings**

1. Whatsapp is the most used application by the user.
2. Most notifications come from Whatsapp.
3. There is a close relationship between number of notifications and app usage.
